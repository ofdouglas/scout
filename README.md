**Scout** is a robot built for remote exploration. While Scout was originally designed to solve a maze for my ECE 499 (Robot Design) course at GMU, Scout could be used to explore any reasonably flat terrain.

**Instructions**
To use Scout, SSH into the raspberry pi and run the 'robot.py' program. Then run the 'operator.py' program on a computer with a keyboard and monitor, passing the IP address of the raspberry pi as a command line argument. Once the video feed begins, use the WASD keys to maneuver Scout. Press ESC to quit.
